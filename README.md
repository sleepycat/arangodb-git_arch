# ArangoDB git

This project builds the development branch of
[ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) and packages it for Arch linux.
If you are curious to explore some new feature in a [technical
preview](https://www.arangodb.com/download-technical-preview/), this is a nice
way to do it.

You will need to be running on either [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
or [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) and have the `makepkg` tool installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com:sleepycat/arangodb-git_arch.git
cd arangodb-git_arch
makepkg
```
