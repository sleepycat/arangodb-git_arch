This is a package for building ArangoDB on Arch Linux.

It pulls the devel branch from https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb
compiles and lovingly packages it for your enjoyment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com:sleepycat/arangodb-git_arch.git
cd arangodb-git_arch
makepkg
```

## TODO:

Figure out how to get DLAGENTS to allow git clone --depth 1
